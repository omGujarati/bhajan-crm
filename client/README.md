# Client Directory

This directory contains frontend-related code and components.

## Structure

The main Next.js application structure is in the root `app/` directory (Next.js requirement), which serves as the client application:

- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `app/api/` - API routes (backend endpoints)
- `app/components/` - React components (create as needed)
- `app/lib/` - Client-side utilities (create as needed)

## Note

Next.js requires the `app/` directory to be at the project root, so the main client code lives there. This `client/` folder can be used for:
- Shared client utilities
- Client-side configuration
- Frontend-specific helpers
